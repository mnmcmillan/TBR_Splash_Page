<p>Based at Fort Eustis, Virginia and part of Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) G-2’s Training Brain Operations Center (TBOC), the Training Brain Repository (TBR) provides a web-enabled cloud service that provides current, relevant Operational Environment (OE) and training information to the Leadership Development, Training, and Educational communities, so they can conduct iterative training that builds on lessons learned, and training assessments.</p>

<p> <em> <strong> “Train as you will fight” means training for the mission under the conditions of expected, anticipated, or plausible OEs. It also means varying the training conditions to improve operational adaptability, training combined arms operations, and ensuring units can operate with all types of military and nonmilitary partners. “Fight,” in the context of training, includes lethal and nonlethal skills in decisive action.   (Training Circular 3-21.20) </strong></em></p>

<p>The TBR allows units to quickly develop tailored exercises at Home Station so that CTC rotations become capstone exercise that demonstrate successes gained by repeated Home Station implementation and training of unit tasks. The TBR provides this flexibility through an intuitive, adaptive platform that provides access to a robust repository of previous training exercises, after action reviews, and Army-wide best practices for accomplishing targeted training objectives for all unit types. The TBR accomplishes this goal by putting theater-specific reports, commanders’ comments, doctrinal documents, the Army standardized Mission Essential Task Lists (METL), and complete training support packages at the fingertips of commanders and training staffs. Leaders at all echelons will be able to find prior training exercises and rapidly upload modifications that address their units’ METL, training objectives, resources, and training location.</p>

<p>Leveraging powerful Cloud Analytics, the TBR—at full functionality—will provide detailed information for designing exercises. As more users upload their specific exercises and tag those exercises by unit, unit type, operation type, duration, OE, METL, or training objective, the TBR will collate data from throughout the Army to provide detailed analytics of training exercises. Not only will it be able to search for training exercises by detailed parameters, it will also be possible to view individual Soldiers’ reactions to training exercises and Exercise Planner recommendations or shortcuts that will ensure training objectives are met in the most efficient manner. These facets of the TBR will ensure that training officers not only search for exercises based on their specific requirements, but that they will also have real-time feedback from previous versions of exercises and be able to avoid common pitfalls and duplicate best practices. In effect, the benefits of lessons learned are distributed throughout the Army in a cloud-based environment that is accessible at the highest and lowest levels. In addition, the Cloud architecture components used to build the TBR are based on components used across the IC’s Cloud Architectures. As more IC Clouds come online, the TBR will be able to interact with and leverage real world intelligence data stored in those clouds to add further realism to training environments. The TBR will become the Army Training Community’s linkage to LandISRNet and the IC Clouds.</p>

		<blockquote>
                    <p> I am battalion commander and based on my use of the Training Brain Repository, I must say that it has been easy to use and navigate and has ultimatly saved me alot of time.  I feel that this application has a lot of potential.</p>
                    
                    <p><em><strong> When asked how much time will the TBR save you </em> </strong> - "it might cut the time in half when compared to traditional methods."</p>
                    </blockquote> 

		<blockquote>
                    <p><em><strong> When asked what do you like most about the TBR </em></strong> - "I have spent a month creating a training event the same amount of detail.  If there is an existing event or even part of events in the database, it can be DONE in less than a day.  It is easy to use with good design principles implemented."</p>
                    
		<p>-"The simplicity and the efficient aligning of training support packages"</p>

		<p>-"Ability to draw from other OPORDs and exercises besides what we currently have here at the MTC" </p>
