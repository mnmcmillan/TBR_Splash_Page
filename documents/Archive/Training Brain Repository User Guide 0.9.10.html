Legacy Training Support Package</h3><p>A legacy Training Support Package is a TSP that was not created using the TBR. A legacy TSP is merely a conglomeration of files and folders that aided in the execution of a previous exercise.  A legacy TSP can be uploaded to the TBR if the unit feels that their TSP is of value to other units. The legacy TSP needs to be packaged in a .zip file and at a minimum consist of nine individual folders. These folders should be titled Event Identification, Event Overview, Tactical Materials, Event Control Materials, Event Setup Materials, Evaluation Plan, Admin Materials, References, and Glossary.  Each of these folders will need to have specific items within (See Figure 16).  However, not every folder will be required for every<br/>training event.<br/>20</p><p class="s4">UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY</p><p><span><IMG width="537" height="342" src="Training Brain Repository User Guide 0.9.10/Image_033.png"/></span></p><p class="s4">UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY</p><p>Figure 16: Legacy TSP Folder Breakdown</p><p class="s27">5.1.

Once the upload has completed, the browser will be redirected to the TSP details page. Provide the details of the uploaded TSP. The details will allow other users to locate and re-use the uploaded TSP (see Figure 18).  The details also serve as filters as shown on the search page of the TBR.<br/>Figure 18: Uploaded TSP Details Page</p><p class="s27">5.2. Reusing a Legacy Training Support Package</p><p>A legacy TSP that has been uploaded to the TBR can be reused by any user of the TBR. However, to reuse a legacy TSP the user must download the legacy TSP the local machine.  To download the legacy TSP of choice use the search function as described previously in the TBR User’s Guide to locate the legacy TSP. Once the legacy TSP has been located select the exercise name download hyperlink to begin downloading the TSP to the user’s local machine (See Figure 19).  Select the location to save the .zip file to (see Figure 20). This will begin the download process and allows users to view the entire contents.<br/>22</p><p class="s4">UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY</p><p><span><IMG width="638" height="359" src="Training Brain Repository User Guide 0.9.10/Image_039.png"/></span></p><p class="s4">UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY</p><p><span><IMG width="249" height="188" src="Training Brain Repository User Guide 0.9.10/Image_040.jpg"/></span><br/>Figure 19: Download a Legacy Training Support Package<br/>Figure 20: Saving Legacy TSP<br/>After the selected TSP has been downloaded, users can view and modify the data to meet their exercise needs and utilize the TBR to complete their exercise specific training requirements by copying and pasting relevant information from the downloaded legacy TSP into the various exercise design phases of the TBR. By reusing the TBR the user is ultimately assisting other users in the future by allowing full reuse capability of the information and the TBR.<br/>It is important to recognize that legacy TSPs must be modified from the downloaded version on the host machine. Changes made to these TSPs after downloading will not be stored in the TBR.  An alternative to this method is to find an existing exercise in the TBR that supports your training requirement, and modify that exercise within the TBR, thus enabling others to collaborate, modify or reuse any component of that exercise.<br/>23</p><p class="s4">UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY</p><p class="s4">UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY</p><h3>6.   Design an Exercise</h3><p class="s9">TRADOC’s Training Circular (TC) 7-101 – Exercise Design Guide; outlines the exercise development process. This process has been automated throughout the TBR to facilitate designing an exercise much quicker than traditional methods. The TBR assists Commanders</p><p class="s9">and staffs in designing an exercise based upon a complex operational environment and creating the necessary supporting documentation, such as OPORDs, Road to War, role player instructions, and master scenario event lists. To accomplish this, the TBR is not only a</p><p class="s9">repository of data and information, it is also a very powerful analytical tool that provides the</p><p class="s9">relevant information to assist in the development of products supporting established exercise conditions, thus helping commanders achieve their training objectives.</p><p><span><IMG width="302" height="118" src="Training Brain Repository User Guide 0.9.10/Image_041.png"/></span></p><p class="s9">The preceding sections will cover in great detail each phase of exercise development as prescribed by TC 7-101. The design process leverages additional Army and Joint Doctrine (i.e. FM 7-15, Decisive Action Training Environment 2.0 and JP 1-01) to ensure accuracy of content and completeness of development. To start a new exercise select <span><IMG width="36" height="15" src="Training Brain Repository User Guide 0.9.10/Image_042.png"/></span>, provide an exercise title and select <span><IMG width="57" height="15" src="Training Brain Repository User Guide 0.9.10/Image_043.jpg"/></span>.  The exercise is now saved in the repository.</p><p>Figure 21: Create New Exercise</p><h4>6.1.        Phase I – Initial Planning</h4><p>The purpose of initial planning is to define and develop the parameters of the exercise. By defining the exercise parameters, certain key decisions can be made, which gives the exercise planner the tools necessary to begin developing the exercise. The initial planning establishes who is to be trained, where they are to be trained, expected training outcomes, and what broad conditions will be replicated in the exercise’s OE to meet the training objectives (TC 7-101).<br/>Navigation through the Exercise design process can be done in multiple ways: via the navigational arrows <span><IMG width="23" height="16" src="Training Brain Repository User Guide 0.9.10/Image_044.jpg"/></span>, <span><IMG width="20" height="15" src="Training Brain Repository User Guide 0.9.10/Image_045.jpg"/></span>, or <span><IMG width="20" height="15" src="Training Brain Repository User Guide 0.9.10/Image_046.jpg"/></span><span class="s17"> </span>at the top of the page.  The navigational arrows are the preferred method for a user to proceed through the exercise design process of the TBR so that a portion of the design process is not overlooked.

Phase IV – Plans, Orders and Instructions</h4><p>Orders, plans and instruction development refer to all the materials and products issued by the exercise director and his/her staff to the training unit. Normally, this includes Operation Orders (OPORDs), Operation Plans (OPLANs), overlays, Warning Orders (WARNOs), Fragmentary Orders (FRAGOs), country studies, intelligence estimates, and adjacent unit orders. In short, all documents required for the training unit to exercise its staff and soldiers during the exercise.  Issue times for these orders vary and the exercise planner should develop an orders issue schedule affording adequate lead times for training units to prepare and issue their orders. This schedule, as well as the documents themselves prior to their issue, may require changes and updates and should be reviewed and updated throughout the exercise. (TC 7-101)</p><h4>6.4.1.
